Implement game modes as configs:
Game modes (fixed random seed, fixed board size):
* solo survival
* battle royal (one of each)
* feast mode (battle royale with LOADs of food)
* famine mode (battle royale with famine on)
* swarm mode (10 of each)
* parasite mode (snake vs parasite, of parasite dies, another starts)
* self rivalry (10, 50, 100 of the same. Report highest?, lowest?)


in game
(M)enu
(S)tats

* Menu as table (can include winner)

Fun idea:
Generate an SVG when running matches (maybe 500 ticks in?)
Preview matches on hovering.
